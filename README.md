# CinemaMern

A simple Mern cinema application. 

Includes:
- Login/Register using Redux
- Book A Ticket
- Download Booked Ticket from Profile Page
- Add A Movie
- Delete Movie

I wish to add more to this but I haven't got the time. Perhaps you can add onto it. 

Important Info: 
- You might notice that only the authentication method has been done using Redux, this is because I applied it halfway into the project.
- The Movie Image URLs are cloudinary links where images have been placed.
- You'll have to add your own MongoDB link in App.js. Movie Data has been provided for you to load up.
